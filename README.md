Weather Wizard

A Magical Weather App Built with Full JS

Inspiration

Weather Wizard is inspired by the need for a simple, intuitive, and accurate weather app that provides users with the information they need to plan their daily activities. We drew inspiration from popular weather apps, but with a twist - we wanted to create an app that is not only functional but also visually appealing and easy to use.

Project Overview

Weather Wizard is a full-stack JavaScript application that provides real-time weather information to users. The app is built using React.js, Node.js, and Express.js, and utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data. The app features a responsive design, allowing users to access it on various devices.

Difficulties

During the development of Weather Wizard, we faced several challenges, including:

Handling API rate limits and implementing caching to reduce the number of requests made to the OpenWeatherMap API
Implementing geolocation to allow users to search for weather data by location
Creating a responsive design that works seamlessly on various devices and screen sizes
Ensuring the app is accessible and follows web accessibility guidelines
